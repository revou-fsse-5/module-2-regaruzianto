# Deploying from GitHub to Netlify

## Prerequisites
1. **GitHub Account**: Ensure you have a GitHub account where your repository is hosted.
2. **Netlify Account**: Sign up for a Netlify account at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) if you haven't already.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Connect GitHub Repository to Netlify
- **Login to Netlify**:
  - Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and log in using your credentials.

- **Create a New Site**:
  - Once logged in, click on **'New site from Git'** button.
  - Choose GitHub as your Git provider.
  - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories if prompted.

- **Select Repository**:
  - Netlify will display a list of your GitHub repositories.
  - Select the repository you want to deploy.

- **Configure Settings**:
  - Choose the branch you want to deploy.
  - Set the build command (if needed) and the directory where the build output resides.

- **Deploy Site**:
  - Click **'Deploy site'**.

### 2. Configure Build Settings (if required)
- Netlify will automatically detect many static site generators (like Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll) and configure build settings accordingly.
- For more complex projects, you may need to specify build commands or environment variables in the Netlify dashboard under **'Site settings > Build & deploy'**.

### 3. Monitor Deployment
- Netlify will start building and deploying your site. You can monitor the progress in the Netlify dashboard under **'Deploys'**.
- Once the build is complete, Netlify will provide you with a unique URL (e.g., `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`) where your site is live.

### 4. Automatic Deployments (Optional)
- Enable continuous deployment to automatically deploy your site whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository:
  - Go to **'Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous Deployment'**.
  - Set up a build hook or enable automatic builds on branch updates.

### 5. Custom Domains (Optional)
- If you have a custom domain:
  - Go to **'Site settings > Domain management'**.
  - Add your custom domain and configure DNS settings.
  - In domain hosting set up Name server from netlify

## Additional Notes
- **Build Hooks**: Use build hooks to trigger builds manually or integrate with other services.
- **Environment Variables**: Manage environment variables in Netlify dashboard under **'Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment'** for secure configuration.

## Troubleshooting
- If your deployment fails, check the build logs in Netlify's dashboard for errors. Common issues include missing dependencies or misconfigured build settings.
